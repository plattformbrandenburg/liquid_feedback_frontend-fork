=Delegation for this area=
You can delegate your vote for this area (independent of your membership in the area) to a person on your contact list. This delegation takes precedence over a potentially existing global delegation, but only, if you don't participate yourself and if you have not given a issue-specific delegation for the respective issue. Please go to the respective issue page for making issue-specific delegations. You can only delegate to members on your contact list. You can extend your contact list anytime in the ,,Members'' area.
